// Predict and explain first...
// Prediction : I think the function won't return anything because it's using console.log() and not return.

function multiply(a, b) {
  console.log(a * b);
  return a*b
}

console.log(`The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is ${multiply(10, 32)}`);
// The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is 320
